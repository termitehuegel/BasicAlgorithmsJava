### Sorting Algorithms
#### [Insertions Sort](/src/de/termitehuegel/basicAlgorithmsJava/sort/Insertionsort.java)
Inertions sort works by divideing the array in two parts. The sorted part and a not sorted part. In the beginning the sorted part just contains the first element of the array. Now for every following element all elements, that are in the sorted part of the arreay and are larger get shifed right. Now the element gets inserted in the sorted part.
#### [Selection Sort](/src/de/termitehuegel/basicAlgorithmsJava/sort/Selectionsort.java)
Selection sort works by iterating trough the array and finding the smallest/largest or both element. These elements get shifted to the beginning/end of the part of the array that is to be sorted.
